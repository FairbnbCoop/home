# The  Project

SafePKT is a project to study and build static analysis technology for the Rust code
used in the PKT project. PKT is a project for disintermediating telecom monopolies by
de-coupling the roles of infrastructure operation from (internet) service provision.
PKT uses a blockchain based on the bitcoin protocol and a proof of work algorithm called
PacketCrypt which requires bandwidth in order to mine. The vision of PacketCrypt is to
drive investment into network infrastructure by creating artificial demand for
bandwidth.

## The Technology

The technology of SafePKT in particular is not developed yet, but the technology of PKT
overall includes [PacketCrypt](https://pkt.cash/PacketCrypt-2020-09-04.pdf)
bandwidth-hard proof of work, [Lightning Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network),
and [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) networking protocol.
