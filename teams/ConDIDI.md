# The ConDIDI Project

ConDIDI will develop the full lifecycle for digital conference credentials. Our first application is to allow conference participants to easily demonstrate their level of involvement at scientific conferences using the technology of self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials. However this technology is not restricted to conferences only, instead it can be used for any kind of credentials.


## The Technology

We will build on the SSI framework already developed by Jolocom. We have not yet made a decision regarding the conference credential front end, and we will first look into the requirements of the users to decide what is a good technology solution. Conference organizers will have to work with digital signatures, so we need to create an easy to use and integrate workflow.


## The Repos

### ConDIDi_frontend
- [ConDIDi_frontend](https://github.com/LedgerProject/ConDIDI_frontend/)
- Repository for the frontend
- Requires a web server
- Interaction with the backend at a later stage
 
### Prototype / Demonstrator
- [Prototype / Demonstrator](https://labs.tib.eu/condidi/)
- This is the prototype we prepared as part of our mid-December deliverable. Jolocom and TIB already have existing codebases. Our mission during LEDGER focuses on researching a way we can make a full lifecycle.
