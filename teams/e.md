# /e/ - Privacy Central app

/e/ an operating system which respect its user privacy!

That why we target to embed a Privacy Central app, in order to let users have a good understanding of what happen with the third party applications they are using. And, in addition, give them tools to protect they privacy.

For the Ledger project, we focus mainly on two features:
1. Tracker blocker: let the user see all analyse and block trackers
2. IP scrambling: let user being able to hide their IP

## The Technology

### Tracker blocker

It relies on a local DNS proxy in order to analyse and block DNS requests. 

### IP scrambling

We will use the Tor network in order to hide the user IP

## The Repos

We are using a single repo to host the Android application
